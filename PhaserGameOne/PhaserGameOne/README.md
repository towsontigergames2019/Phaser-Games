# PhaserGameOne

This file is created to allow testing on a local server while Kentico is being set up by another team. The local server was created using node.js, 
specifically the Express.js library. DO NOT modify the server.js file without permission of the file creator. If you have issues with the localhost,
please contact the file creator. 

You may modify the public file which is where all the html, css, and javascript contents will be! Within the javascript file, there is also an
assets file to be used by the Phaser game. The assets file will be organized over time. Happy programming!!
